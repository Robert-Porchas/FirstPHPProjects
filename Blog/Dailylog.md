7/2 Creation of page, I linked the different pages I have craeted thus far and plan to make another page that 
    utilizes the script I made to scan ports, I also plan to make a bandwidth monitor at some point soon.
7/6 Added the port scanner pages, had to modify the code to work for a server and also gave it a light version
    because it was taking so long on server side to check every port. This was also my first day doing git pushes
    remotely from my terminal.
